		<Name>The Path to the Dwarven Village</Name>
		<Description>You walk in the hill's shadow down an ever-widening path which leads to the
outskirts of the dwarven village.  The hill rises above you to the southwest,
and a smaller path leads to its crest in that direction.  A tunnel here leads
down a short distance into the hill itself, and the dwarven village can be
seen near the mountains to the north. </Description>
