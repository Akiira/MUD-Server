		<Name>The Path to the Dwarven Village</Name>
		<Description>You walk in the hill's shadow down an ever-widening path which leads to the
outskirts of the dwarven village.  The hill rises above you to the southwest,
and a smaller path leads to its crest in that direction.  A tunnel here leads
down a short distance into the hill itself, and the dwarven village can be
seen near the mountains to the north. </Description>

		<Name>Path nearing the Mountain</Name>
		<Description>You are near the base a rugged mountain.  Dense forest prevents passage in
most directions, and it grows dark to the north as the path begins its way
up the shadowed mountain.</Description>

		<Name>Top of the Mountain</Name>
		<Description>You stand on the mountain's top.  Far to the south you can see the spires
of the city of Darkhaven, and a path leads down the mountainside to its
base in that direction.  To your east and west, large gates have been
built into the rock face.</Description>
